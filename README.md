# An uncertainty-guided deep learning method facilitates rapid screening of CYP3A4 inhibitors

### This study aims to establish a novel uncertainty-guided DL method for screening CYP3A4 inhibitors. In particular, we address many issues to make the approach in practice.

### The results show that the uncertainty method could effectively calibrate the error distribution and accurately characterize the correlation between uncertainty and prediction errors. Consequently, predictions with higher confidence exhibit better performance.
